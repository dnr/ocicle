These images were all taken between March and July 2012 (except the ones from
Iceland, taken in July 2011). Many were composed from multiple exposures, and a
few are wide panoramas that let you look around inside them. Most have more than
the typical resolution of images on the web, so feel free to zoom in to see more
detail.

A few details you might try looking for:

an abandoned trailer,
cruise ships,
a harp,   # nativity facade
a radio tower,
a roman statue,
some gruesome creatures,
stitching artifacts,
a bird in Barcelona,
