These images were all taken between March and July 2012 (except the ones from
Iceland, taken in July 2011). Many were composed from multiple exposures, and a
few are wide panoramas that let you look around inside them. Most have more than
the typical resolution of images on the web, so feel free to zoom in to see more
detail.

[if mobile]

On a mobile browser, use the familiar gestures to scroll and zoom. Touch once on
an image to center it.

[elif mac]

On a Mac, use the scroll gestures to zoom, not pinch-to-zoom. Click and drag to
scroll, and click once on an image to center it. (Unfortunately, pinch-to-zoom
behavior can't currently be overridden.)

[else]

On a desktop browser, click and drag to scroll, use the mouse wheel to zoom, and
click once on an image to center it.

[end]
